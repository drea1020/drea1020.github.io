    <h1 style="text-align: left;">About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm a Venezuelan-born Miami girl, but I graduated from UNC, so I have a soft spot for Chapel Hill and pink dogwood trees. I've been designing since before I knew I could make a career out of it but I also have a passion for coding and I never get tired of watching my designs come to life. I'm an avid baker, a movie buff and a vegetarian (90% of the time).</p>
    <p>I love Jesus, Jane Austen novels and anything by the Bronte sisters, but especially Jane Eyre. I'm a huge fan of Impressionist art and superheroes, with a particular love for Batman. For everything else, you'll just have to get to know me!</p>
