        <p><strong>Project:</strong> Responsive Website</p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Hulett wanted a responsive redesign of their website. Their old website was difficult to navigate and visually cluttered. The new website is easy to navigate and has a clean, modern style with clear calls to action. Customers can easily log in to their account, pay their bill or find their nearest Hulett location at the top of the page.</p>
